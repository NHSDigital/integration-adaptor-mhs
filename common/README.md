# NHS Integration Adaptors Common Utilities

This package contains common utilities used by the various projects that make up the NHS integration adaptors.

## Installation
To use this package as part of your project, ensure you have `pipenv` installed and on your path, then from your
project's directory run:
```
pipenv install git+ssh://git@github.com/nhsconnect/integration-adaptor-common.git@0.0.1#egg=integration-adaptors-common
```

### Run Tests
From the integration-adaptor-common folder
- `pipenv run unittests` will run all unit tests.

### Coverage
From the integration-adaptor-common folder
- `pipenv run unittests-cov` will run all unit tests, generating a [Coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) report
in the `test-reports` directory.
- `pipenv run coverage-report` will print the coverage report generated by `unittests-cov`
- `pipenv run coverage-report-xml` will produce an XML version of the coverage report generated by `unittests-cov`, in a
[Cobertura](http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/) compatible format
- `pipenv run coverage-report-html` will produce an HTML version of the coverage report generated by `unittests-cov`

### Analysis
To use sonarqube analysis you will need to have installed `sonar-scanner`. \
Ensure sonar-scanner is on your path, and configured for the sonarqube host with appropriate token. \
`sonar-scanner` will use `sonar-project.properties` to submit source to sonarqube for analysis.
 (See: [SonarQube](https://gpitbjss.atlassian.net/wiki/x/XQFfXQ))\
NOTE: Coverage will not show in the analysis unless you have already generated the xml report (as per above.)
